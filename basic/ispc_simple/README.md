# ISPC simple example

This is an example using ISPC (taken from the ISPC git repository).  Runs
a fairly arbitrary data-parallel loop over a 16-entry vector.
Running `make` will produce an executable (`simple`) that you can try out.

You must have the `llvm` module loaded before building this example.
