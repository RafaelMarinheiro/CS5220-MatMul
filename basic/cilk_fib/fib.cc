 * Time how long it takes to calculate a Fibonacci number. See
 * http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number for information about the
 * Fibonacci sequence. This application demonstrates the use of the cilk_spawn
 * and cilk_sync keywords.
 *
 * This program takes a single parameter to specify the number of workers to
 * be used in the calculation. If not specified, Intel Cilk Plus will query
 * the operating system to determine the number of cores on the system and use
 * that many workers.
