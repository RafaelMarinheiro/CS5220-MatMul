# CS 5220

This is the public repository for the Spring 2014 run of Cornell CS 5220:
Application of Parallel Computers.  Please see the [wiki][wiki] for information
on this software and the C4 cluster environment.  The programs in the `basic`
subdirectory illustrate concretely how to compile and run different types of
parallel codes.
