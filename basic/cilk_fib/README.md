# Cilk Plus example

[Intel Cilk Plus](https://www.cilkplus.org/) is a language extension
to C and C++ that expresses task parallelism (via spawning and parallel for)
and data parallelism (via array notation and SIMD vectorization pragmas).
This is one of many varieties of Cilk, which started as an academic project
at MIT, evolved into a company (Cilk Arts), and then was purchased by Intel.

You must have the `icsxe` (Intel Composer Studio XE) module loaded to
build and run this example.
