# Lecture notes

While the compiled lecture notes will be hosted from my home page,
the sources will generally be in the class repository.  Running `make`
will build the slides (those that need to be built) and copy them
into the `web` subdirectory.  I use Textile rather than Markdown for
the lectures page purely becase Textile has better support for tables.
